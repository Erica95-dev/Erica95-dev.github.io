<h2>Who am I? </h2>
<p> I am a 25 year old developer in the making who loves to interact with people from different walks of life; I love diversity! I love learning new customs and about others' backgrounds. I'm the type of person that wants to know why you are like you are... I guess you could say I generally take interest in others. I'm a dog love; I have a fur baby named ACE  <img src="images/funny%20eyes%20dog.jpeg" alt="dog with cartoon eyes filter" width="200px" height="200px"> Ace loves chilling, talking pictures, and loves playing.<img src="images/ACE%20w:%20glasses.jpeg" alt="Dog wearing glasses" width="200px" height="200px">

        I consider myself to bu funny outgoing but not too risky.<img src="images/pool%20fun.jpg" alt=" Erica taking pictures in the pool" Width="200px" height="200px"> Meaning if your every find yourself involved in situation where hieghts is involved, your probably better off getting someone else! Which leads me to speak on my weaknesses. Without a doubt heights, I know there's something about people who are afraid of heights because they are afraid of falling... Which may be true in some situations but in others I'm just being totally realistic, Like why should I sit strapped into a chair and mentally prepare myself to be flung a 100ft in the air? In actuality that's a huge goal of mine and not passing out in the process of course.</p>
    
    <p>I love hosting game nights and having mentaly stimulating conversations. <img src="images/games.jpg" alt=" Erica hosting a game night" Width="200px" height="200px">Also, I love children and I have two wonderful nephews and one on the way. My favorite thing about being an auntie is playing and spoiling my nephews every chance I get! <img src="images/n1.jpg" alt=" Erica with her nephew " Width="200px" height="200px"> <img src="images/n2.JPG" alt=" Erica with her nephew" Width="200px" >
    <img src="images/n3.jpg" alt=" Erica with her nephew" Width="200px" height="200px"> <img src="images/n4.JPG" alt=" Erica with her nephew" Width="200px" height="200px"> Why because at the end of the day I drop them back off with their parents,so I wouldn't have to deal with the aftermath. So, yes, I've already accepted the karma that's brewing for me when I start my family lol! I'm expecting no sleep. </p>
    
    <p>One of my strengths, I would say, is interacting with others. Honestly I have no idea how that came about, mainly since all of my siblings are the total opposite. I love talking to people on different notes whether it is on a good or bad note, I love to help. I love to improve qualities and situations. It warms my heart and puts a smile on my face to see others doing well and succeeding in life without competition.</p>

     My dream is to develop educational applications for those with developmental disabilities. I'm talking applications for adults and children on many levels. I plan to even go steps further and develop applications for parents who are homeschooling their children as I wish to do someday. </span>
